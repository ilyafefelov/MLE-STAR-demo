# Copilot Instructions for MLE-STAR Churn Prediction Project

- [x] Project scaffolded for Python ML pipeline with MLE-STAR agentic workflow.
- [x] Customize the project for telecom churn prediction using MLE-STAR.
- [x] Install required Python dependencies.
- [x] Compile and validate the project.
- [x] Prepare and run tasks for pipeline execution.
- [x] Launch and document the project.
- [x] Ensure documentation is complete.

## Project Structure
- `solution.py`: End-to-end ML pipeline script
- `data/telecom_churn.csv`: Dataset location
- `report.md` or `report.html`: Performance summary
- `process_log.md`: Iterative process log

## Development Rules
- Use Python 3.11, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Integrate with MLE-STAR, LangChain, CrewAI, SQLite, FastAPI as needed
- Prioritize F1-score, report Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- Ensure interpretability and robustness
