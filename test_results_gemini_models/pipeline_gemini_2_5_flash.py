    # SimpleImputer is included for robustness in real-world scenarios where
    # similar datasets might have missing values.

    # --- Preprocessing Step ---
    # This pipeline handles initial data cleaning and scaling.
    preprocessor = Pipeline([
        # Imputation: Addresses potential missing values in numerical features.
        # The 'mean' strategy replaces NaN values with the mean of the column.
        # While the 'breast_cancer' dataset is typically complete, this step
        # makes the pipeline robust for similar real-world datasets that might
        # have occasional missing entries.

        # Scaling: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
        # This is crucial for models sensitive to the magnitude of features (like SVMs)
        # and for dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA), ensuring all features
        # contribute equally to the distance calculations and principal components.

    # This pipeline performs dimensionality reduction to potentially reduce noise,
    # multicollinearity, and computational cost, while retaining important information.
    feature_engineering = Pipeline([
        # PCA (Principal Component Analysis): A linear dimensionality reduction technique.
        # For the 'breast_cancer' dataset (30 features), PCA can help in:
        # 1. Reducing the number of features, which can speed up training and reduce model complexity.
        # 2. Mitigating multicollinearity by transforming original correlated features
        #    into uncorrelated principal components.
        # 3. Potentially improving model generalization by focusing on the most variance-explaining directions.
        #
        # Hyperparameter `n_components=0.95`: This means PCA will select the minimum number
        # of principal components such that 95% of the total variance in the data is retained.
        # This is a common and robust choice, balancing reduction with information preservation.
        # `random_state=42`: Ensures reproducibility, especially if 'arpack' or 'randomized'
        # solvers are implicitly used or if there's any stochasticity in SVD approximation.

    # --- Model Step ---
    # The chosen classification model for the binary classification task.
    # SVC (Support Vector Classifier): A powerful and versatile model, often performing
    # very well on medium-sized, complex datasets like 'breast_cancer'. It works by
    # constructing hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space that optimally separates the classes.
    #
    # Hyperparameters:
    # - `C=1.0`: Regularization parameter. This controls the trade-off between achieving
    #   a low training error and a large margin. A smaller C allows for more misclassifications
    #   (larger margin, potentially underfitting), while a larger C tries to classify
    #   all training samples correctly (smaller margin, potential overfitting). 1.0 is a
    #   good default starting point for many problems.
    # - `kernel='rbf'`: Radial Basis Function (Gaussian) kernel. This allows SVC to learn
    #   non-linear decision boundaries, which is often beneficial for real-world datasets
    #   that might not be linearly separable, such as medical or biological data.
    # - `random_state=42`: Ensures reproducibility. While SVC with 'rbf' kernel and default
    #   solver is largely deterministic, including `random_state` is a good practice for
    #   overall pipeline consistency and future robustness against solver changes or
    #   stochastic processes if `probability=True` were to be set.
    model = SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', random_state=42)

    # 3. 'model' (SVC for classification)
